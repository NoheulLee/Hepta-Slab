# FONTLOG for the Hepta Slab fonts

This file provides detailed information on the Hepta Slab Font Software. This information should be distributed along with the Hepta Slab fonts and any
derivative works.

## Basic Font Information
Hepta Slab is a slab-serif revival based on specimens of antique genre types from Bruce and Co., primarily Antique 307. The family consists of 9 weights with the extremes intended for display use and the middle weights for setting text.

*Note: Glyphs marked in a color are indicated on labelkey.txt file in the sources folder. The list can be viewed in Glyphs App with the LabelKey plugin via the Glyphs Plugin Manager.*
